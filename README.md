# Thyroid Disease Prediction using PCA and comparison of various machine learning classifiers
Diagnosis of a disease involves analyzing symptoms and predicting whether a person is affected or not. The analysis of symptoms is a complex task.
Machine learning plays an important role in medical field and prediction of diseases. Thyroid disease is one of the common diseases and its major side-effects are as follows:
* Gain/loss of weight
* Stress
* Sexual dysfunction

The main idea is to collect all past data regarding the disease, to analyze them with various MACHINE LEARNING algorithms and to find the best accurate one by comparing the results.
The dataset was collected from UCI Machine learning repository, which had 7200 instances. 
* 3772 - training data 
* 3428 - testing data
* 3 - classes
